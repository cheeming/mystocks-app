Release Build
-------------

If you want to try out a Release build, that doesn't depend on React Native Packager:

 * Go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
 * Select Run, and change Build Configuration to be Release
 * Click Product > Run (Play Button) to re-install in Device
 * More details here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device-ios.html
